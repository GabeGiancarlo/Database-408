Outer Joins and Subqueries
CPSC408
OUTER JOINS - Using the Sakila database in MySQL, create the following queries
using outer joins:
1. Show the address IDs of all addresses in the 'California' District that do not
have a store. (9 rows).
2. Show me all film names and how many stores they are inventoried at. Return
all films, even if they are not in stock in any store. (1000 rows)
3. Show me the first names of all actors and the titles of films they are in. All
actors should be returned, even if they have no films. (5462 rows)
4. Show me all actorIDs and all filmIDs, matching where the actor has been in
the film and still showing all actors and all films who have no matches. (5465
rows)
SUBQUERIES - Using the Sakila database in MySQL, create the following queries
using subqueries:
5. Write a query to return the rental duration of each film from the film table.
Return a second column in this same query that is the average rental duration of
all films. (Result: 1000 Rows)
6. Write a query to return the number of categories from the film_category table
that have over 60 films in them. (Result: 10)
7. Write a query to return the average payment amount of all payments that were
made by customers in Mexico (this will be a long query). (Result: 4.154573)
8. Write a query that returns the same result as question 3, using NO subqueries.
